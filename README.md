#
A discord bot that performs a variety of functions. These include a calculator, changing nicknames, changing name color, image searches, an audio player, and more!

## Invitation
GrouchBot requires administrator permissions to perform all of its functions. If you are not comfortable with that, do not invite him! Invitation link will be added here eventually once I get around to hosting the bot on my Raspberry Pi 3.

## Help
To get help and a more indepth description of commands, type !help after inviting GrouchBot to your server. He'll send you a PM with a list of commands and their functions.
